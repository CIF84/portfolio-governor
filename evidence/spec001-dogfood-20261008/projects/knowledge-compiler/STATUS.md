# Knowledge Compiler — Current Status

This is the authoritative repository handoff for current work coordination. Agents must not infer active work from filename recency.

## Accepted learner-facing baseline

`SPEC-038 — dominant explanatory diagram canvas`

Owner verdict: `NEW_VISUAL_BASELINE_EXPLANATORY_ARCHITECTURE_CONFIRMED`

## Extraction state

Candidate B v2 (`spec-051-candidate-b-v2`) admitted 8/9 blind sources in SPEC-052 with zero known-invalid admission. Extraction decomposition remains unpromoted.

## Representation evidence

SPEC-057 established:

> **A representation must earn its complexity by externalizing cognitive work the learner would otherwise perform mentally.**

SPEC-058 owner verdict: `UTILITY_GATE_CONFIRMED_REPRESENTATION_FORM_REMAINS_UNRESOLVED`.

SPEC-059 owner verdict: `ENRICHED_PROSE_CONCEPT_SUPPORTED_SELECTION_MODEL_REQUIRES_REFINEMENT`.

## Progressive semantic compression direction

> **Knowledge Compiler transforms source material into trustworthy, cognition-efficient representations of knowledge at variable resolution.**

Core principle:

> **Compression is a view over knowledge, not destruction of knowledge.**

SPEC-060 established mechanically that six frozen sources can be represented at smaller R1/R2 resolutions with zero detected loss under the current semantic/epistemic audits and 100% provenance coverage.

Owner review of case 01 exposed a missing preservation dimension.

SPEC-060 owner verdict:

`SEMANTIC_CONTENT_PRESERVED_EXPLANATORY_STRUCTURE_NOT_PRESERVED`

Accepted owner findings:

- R1 mostly shortened/broke apart source prose and did not materially improve cognitive processing;
- R2 exposed information types but disrupted the natural chain of thought;
- R0's paragraphs sometimes acted as useful containers of coherent meaning;
- paragraph boundaries are evidence, not a universal semantic unit;
- the source carried useful explanatory traversal in addition to domain facts;
- preserving modeled facts while losing mechanism → example → consequence → observation/generalization flow increases reconstruction burden;
- raw word-count compression is not a sufficient objective;
- some linguistic/discourse material is useful because it tells the learner how pieces of domain knowledge fit into an explanation.

Canonical refinement:

> **Semantic preservation is necessary but not sufficient; useful explanatory structure is itself information that compression should preserve.**

> **Preserve useful explanatory work already present in the source before compressing its language.**

## SPEC-061 owner verdict

`EXPLANATORY_STRUCTURE_SUPPORTED_HIERARCHY_AND_CHUNKING_INCOMPLETE`

Owner review established that SPEC-061 is a meaningful improvement over SPEC-060: block-preserving explanation can preserve natural thought flow and useful compression. Remaining gaps are hierarchical conceptual chunking and preservation of necessary implications/edges.

Key findings:
- geology: one shared spreading mechanism should organize multiple example/manifestation branches rather than a flat chain;
- astronomy: endpoint facts survived but E2 weakened a crucial implication from accumulated mass to eventual star/planet formation;
- meteorology: information density may be irreducible linguistically, while the number of independent conceptual units remains cognitively expensive;
- linguistic compression, chunk compression, and structural compression are distinct;
- traversal describes how an explanation is presented; schema describes how knowledge is organized;
- visualization remains downstream.

## SPEC-062 owner verdict

`CONCEPTUAL_SCHEMA_SUPPORTED_RAW_SCHEMA_NOT_COGNITIVELY_USEFUL`

Additional finding: `S1_S2_DISTINCTION_NOT_PERCEPTIBLE`.

Owner review rejected S1/S2 as learner representations. The surfaces exposed compiler machinery—schema enums, block counts, repeated facts, chunk IDs, and relation ledgers—rather than making conceptual organization perceptible. The raw schema may remain a useful intermediate representation, but IR is not UI.

Canonical lesson:

> **Every internal abstraction must cross a separate cognitive-utility boundary before learner exposure.**

Do not modify the frozen SPEC-062 schema in response to this verdict. The next experiment isolates projection only.

## SPEC-063 owner verdict

`REPRESENTATION_COMPILATION_BLOCKED_BY_INSUFFICIENT_CONCEPTUAL_ABSTRACTION`

Accepted findings:

- `GROUPING_IS_NOT_ABSTRACTION`
- `REPRESENTATION_WORK_PAUSED_PENDING_CORE_COMPILER_ARCHITECTURE`

All three P2 treatments were materially insufficient as learner representations. They reorganized or decorated largely uncompressed semantic material, leaving too much text and information for direct reading and failing to produce a cognitively useful compressed knowledge architecture. The primary failure remains in schema, synthesis, and conceptual abstraction rather than learner-facing visual grammar.

SPEC-063 is closed without promotion. Its evidence remains frozen.

Canonical doctrine:

> **UI exists to test the compiler, not to compensate for it.**

> **Representation work remains paused until the core compression and abstraction architecture is validated.**

## SPEC-064 owner verdict

`DETERMINISTIC_PRESERVATION_CONFIRMED_SEMANTIC_ABSTRACTION_REQUIRES_GENERATIVE_CANDIDATE`

Accepted evidence:
- deterministic machinery preserved all 141 semantic commitments and 54 implications with full backwards recovery;
- R0/R1/R2/R3 aggregate words were 1,315 / 1,275 / 1,315 / 1,576;
- carriers were 66 / 69 / 63 / 63;
- only three supported groups and two labels were produced;
- zero explanatory abstractions were earned;
- deterministic transformation is strong at trust/preservation but did not demonstrate semantic synthesis or conceptual abstraction.

Canonical division-of-labor hypothesis:

> **Generative intelligence proposes semantic synthesis and abstraction; deterministic compiler machinery validates trust boundaries and decides admission.**

This remains unvalidated until a bounded live experiment succeeds.

## SPEC-065 owner verdict

`DETERMINISTIC_TRUST_BOUNDARY_CONFIRMED_SEMANTIC_ENTAILMENT_GAP_NEXT`

Accepted findings:
- restricted deterministic proof can validate identity, provenance, schema, exact/restricted coverage, quantities and frozen structural assertions;
- 30/30 adversarial fixtures behaved as expected under those restricted proofs;
- genuinely novel synthesis/paraphrase, shared mechanism/abstraction, implicit semantic substitutions/dependencies, and relation projection onto compressed endpoints cannot be proven by lexical/structural checks;
- pretending those checks establish entailment would create a false trust boundary;
- live synthesis remains unauthorized until semantic admission is addressed.

Canonical architecture under investigation:

```text
generator candidate
      ↓
deterministic validation
      ↓
semantic entailment validation
      ↓
ADMIT / REJECT / UNCERTAIN
```

`UNCERTAIN` fails closed.

## SPEC-066 owner verdict

`SEMANTIC_JUDGMENT_REQUIRED_LIVE_JUDGE_VALIDATION_NEXT`

Accepted evidence:
- 92 frozen fixtures across eight domains;
- zero false admissions under deterministic protocols;
- Protocol A resolved 8/92 and Protocol B 16/92;
- all four genuinely semantic SPEC-065 gaps remain unresolved;
- projected synthesis judging would require 423 precision-first or 111 bounded-batch calls;
- atomization and same-family generator/judge correlated-error risks remain unresolved.

Canonical trust architecture under test:

```text
generative candidate
      ↓
deterministic validation
      ↓
semantic judgment
      ↓
ADMIT / REJECT / UNCERTAIN
```

`UNCERTAIN` fails closed. Model confidence is not proof.

## SPEC-067 owner verdict

`LIVE_JUDGE_NOT_TESTED_ATOMIC_EXECUTION_CONTRACT_REQUIRES_REPAIR`

Accepted evidence:
- zero provider/model calls and zero fixture transmissions occurred;
- semantic-judge quality remains unmeasured;
- the frozen 92-fixture corpus contains 76 opaque carriers and 16 explicit two-component AND fixtures;
- the proposed 48-fixture subset contained 49 declared carriers;
- J1 requires one independently validated atomic commitment per call;
- fixture identity is not atomic-judgment identity;
- one valid conjunct must never license an unsupported conjunct;
- silently collapsing a fixture into one atom or expanding the frozen call manifest would weaken/violate the trust contract.

Canonical rule:

> **Fixture is the evaluation container; atomic commitment is the semantic judgment unit.**

## Architecture audit gate

SPEC-068 owner verdict:

`ATOMIC_TRUST_CONTRACT_VALID_BUT_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_REQUIRED_BEFORE_FURTHER_COMPLEXITY`

Accepted evidence:
- the safe atomic subset retained all eight domains but only 2/18 semantic categories;
- no representative semantic-judge experiment can be run from the current safely atomized corpus;
- the locally obvious next step would be bounded atomization;
- owner and ChatGPT explicitly pause that path before adding another semantic/model layer;
- the original product thesis demonstrated promising learner value with a much simpler frontier-model transformation, while recent architecture has accumulated substantial trust/research complexity without comparable demonstrated learner progress;
- sunk implementation effort is not evidence that the current architecture should survive.

Canonical audit rule:

> **Start from the product thesis, not from the current architecture. Add components only when evidence demonstrates that they are necessary to deliver learner value at acceptable trust, complexity, cost and time.**

## Independent audit outcome

IA-001 v1.0 was completed in a fresh GPT-6 Astra Extra High context using only the frozen initial auditor package. The auditor verified the package, visually inspected the original 16-page electromagnetism prototype, examined no additional project context, and froze its diagnosis before exposure to current-team hypotheses.

Independent diagnosis:
- bounded reliability gains and engineering learning are demonstrated;
- improved learning outcomes over the original prototype are not demonstrated;
- the provisional minimum research candidate is direct source-bounded explanation with source recovery and independent fidelity review;
- stronger planning/semantic architectures must earn their extra complexity empirically;
- strongest counterargument: a persistent trustworthy knowledge workspace may justify semantic infrastructure if a better explanatory composer makes that investment useful.

The auditor independently froze five candidate architectures and the discriminating benchmark design `IA-001-BENCH-v1`.

Canonical benchmark question:

> **What is the minimum machinery required to reproduce the learner value that motivated Knowledge Compiler, without unacceptable fidelity loss?**

## Current approved work packet

```text
specs/BENCH-001-ia001-benchmark-execution-readiness.md
```

Status: `APPROVED_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION`

Authority: `OFFLINE_ONLY`

Human gate: `OWNER_REVIEW`

Promotion: `NOT_AUTHORIZED`

## Current gate

BENCH-001 is authorized to make the frozen independent benchmark executable **before any benchmark source is selected or exposed**.

Frozen benchmark arms:
- S — source control;
- A — one-call direct explanation;
- B — two-call plan then explain;
- C0 — current compiler behavior;
- C+ — competitive semantic compiler with up to three typed extraction stages plus source-aware explanatory composition.

Future five-source maximum: 40 model calls. No judge, retry, repair or enrichment calls.

BENCH-001 must freeze prompts/schemas, common model policy, executables/dependencies, neutral renderer, budgets, failure semantics, metrics, source-selector handoff, fidelity-review contract, blinding/custody tooling and learner-review templates.

Preferred offline common-model candidate: `gpt-6.1-sol` / high / `store=False`; no silent substitution. Remote provider support may remain unverified until a later execution packet.

No benchmark source retrieval/selection, model/provider calls, benchmark output generation, learner/fidelity review, atomization/semantic-judge continuation, architecture promotion or benchmark winner selection is authorized.

## Current product question

S   source
A   source → direct explanation
B   source → explanation plan → explanation
C0  source → current compiler
C+  source → semantic compiler → source-aware composer

## Explicitly forbidden

There is no active approved work packet. Do not execute semantic judging or
SPEC-065 synthesis, retrieve sources, rerun extraction, alter frozen fixtures or
labels, weaken validators, replace the atomic judgment contract, change
production semantics/representation/UI/navigation, promote experimental work,
assign the human verdict, or activate follow-up execution. A proposed manifest
